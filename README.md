**Final report is in the doc folder named "Proj1_HanLin.html" or "Proj1_HanLin.nb.ntml", you need to download it to see the final results and visualization.**

**Final rmd file is in the doc folder named "Proj1_HanLin.Rmd", which contains all the code.**

### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title: **Democratic VS Republican -- What can we know from president inauguration speeches?**
+ This project is conducted by **Han Lin (hl3006)**



+ Project summary: 

As we all know, Democratic Party and Republican Party are two major contemporary political parties in the United States, the former is more progressive and the latter is more conservative.
The two parties differ in their policies but also have similarities.

As American people vote to decide next president, they are basically choosing parties, in most cases, between Democratic and Republican. So one question we could ask is: what are the differences and similarities of the president inauguration speeches from different parties?

In this project, I will analyze inauguration speeches of different presidents from Democratic and Republican, trying to find differences and similarities. Here is some questions we want to find the answer:


* Will the presidents of the two parties differ in length of their speechs?

* Are there any differences of the length of sentence of speechs for two parties?

* What are the most frequent said words in the speech for two parties?

* How do typical words like 'freedom', 'people', 'government' show in the speeches?

* How does emotion change in the speeches and compared between two parties?

- The `data` folder contains the raw data of this project. These data should NOT be processed inside this folder. Processed data should be saved to `output` folder. This is to ensure that the raw data will not be altered. 
- The `doc` folder should have documentations for this project, presentation files and other supporting materials. 
- The `figs` folder contains figure files produced during the project and running of the codes. 
- The `lib` folder contain computation codes for your data analysis. Make sure your README.md is informative about what are the programs found in this folder. 
- The `output` folder is the holding place for intermediate and final computational results.



Please see each subfolder for a README file.
