### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title: Democratic VS Republican -- What can we know from president inauguration speeches?
+ This project is conducted by Han Lin (hl3006)

+ Project summary: 

As we all know, Democratic Party and Republican Party are two major contemporary political parties in the United States, the former is more progressive and the latter is more conservative.
The two parties differ in their policies but also have similarities.

As American people vote to decide next president, they are basically choosing parties, in most cases, between Democratic and Republican. So one question we could ask is: what are the differences and similarities of the president inauguration speeches from different parties?

In this project, I will analyze inauguration speeches of different presidents from Democratic and Republican, trying to find differences and similarities. Here is some questions we want to find the answer:


* Will the presidents of the two parties differ in length of their speechs?

* Are there any differences of the length of sentence of speechs for two parties?

* What are the most frequent said words in the speech for two parties?

* How do typical words like 'freedom', 'people', 'government' show in the speeches?

* How does emotion change in the speeches and compared between two parties?
