# Project: 
### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. 

"Proj1_HanLin.Rmd" is the final rmd file.

"Proj1_HanLin.html" and "Proj1_HanLin.nb.html" are both final report(they are actually the same) with code and visualization, you need to download the file to see them.
